# Healthcare Chatbot – Disease Prediction Using BERT

This is an AI-based healthcare chatbot that predicts **potential diseases** from user-described symptoms. It uses a fine-tuned **BERT** model for understanding the input and classifying it into the most likely disease.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a chatbot system to predict diseases based on symptom input
- Use BERT for understanding and classifying medical symptom descriptions
- Train on a labeled dataset of symptoms and disease names
- Create a simple and user-friendly interface
- Evaluate chatbot performance against known disease labels

---

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (`Bert Flask3.ipynb`)
- HuggingFace Transformers
- PyTorch
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- HTML, CSS, JS (frontend interface in `livedoc/` folder)

---
## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open `bertflask.ipynb` using **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Run all cells to:
   - Load the tokenizer and model
   - Input symptoms and get disease predictions

## ⚠️ Note on Model File

The model file (`model.tensor`) is **not uploaded** here because it's larger than GitHub's 100MB limit.
